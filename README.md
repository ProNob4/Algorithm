# Sorting Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. These algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are commonly used to organize data in ascending or descending order. The code provided demonstrates how each sorting algorithm works and serves as a useful learning resource.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Counting Sort**
- **Radix Sort**
- **Bucket Sort**
- **Tim Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Comb Sort**
- **Bogo Sort**
- **Cycle Sort**

## Getting Started

To run the sorting algorithms on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed. You can use `gcc` or any other C compiler of your choice.

- **GCC Compiler:** [Download here](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms-c.git
cd sorting-algorithms-c
